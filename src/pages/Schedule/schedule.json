However, more often than not, your models may perform slow or your system faces downtimes and model degradation a lot. How do you ensure that your ML pipeline doesn’t face downtimes and become a bottleneck in the growth of your business?\r\n\r\nAt Dynopii, we work with real-time deep learning-based models for our products and services that run 24x7. One of the first challenges we solved was to keep our models running with 0 downtimes despite multiple updates to it every day. I’ll be talking about how to analyze your ML pipeline and how to design an ML Cloud solution architecture that keeps your critical business processes running smoothly through both planned and unplanned outages.\r\n\r\nThis session will be agnostic to cloud service providers!",

This means that the API developers need to add functionalities like authentication, rate limiting, traffic control, and monitoring to each microservice.\r\n\r\nMoreover, making changes to the API, like splitting or combining services, puts a burden on the consumers, requiring them to update their client applications.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to adopt an API gateway to sit between your client and your microservices.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Navendu walks through API development best practices and how API gateways simplify API development. He walks through how API developers can ensure security, deliver scalability, improve monitoring and analytics, and streamline development while building APIs for the evolving cloud.",

              "description": "We all remember the famous phrase of Andreessen Horowitz, “Software is Eating the world”. It was definitely true at the time, but times have changed. It’s APIs that are now eating the world. Using APIs to expose core business functionality and facilitate service-to-service communication has become standard. Not only does it give us several control points but also makes it easier to deal with complex modern applications. Although these modern API-driven applications come with significant benefits in delivery speed and scalability, they also have issues like design complexity, visibility, communication, and the most important one, API security. \r\n\r\nIt is becoming increasingly urgent as API-related attacks are impacting companies across nearly all sectors, resulting in skyrocketing costs for businesses. In the U.S. alone, the average annual API-related cyber loss is estimated to be USD $12-23 billion. \r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to deal with this is to make API security a part of your SDLC. API Security testing is one of the ways to do that. API security testing helps in finding vulnerabilities in very early stages, giving developers and Product security engineers more time and context to build resilient systems. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we intend to explain the rationale behind integrating API security testing into your Development life cycle to build secure applications and APIs using various OSS and Enterprise tools. We will also discuss some real-world scenarios which will help you solve the ultimate debate on Delivery v/s Security and solve for cascading impacts, ever so common in today’s world of distributed systems.",

So when the user is using the app, the data is collected and accordingly the app can be personalised based on data analysis. \r\n\r\nBut this can be a tedious process to launch a new update, where you have to go through app development, testing, deployment, submission, approval and then releases. \r\n\r\nUntil a lot of damage had been already done, and many users have already left the application. \r\n\r\nNot anymore. With firebase remote config you can change the app behaviour and add app personalization on the GO. Directly through the cloud. And it will be available to all the users immediately. \r\n\r\nWith remote config and AB testing, we can also test if the new feature is liked by the user or not.\r\n\r\nMust say firebase remote config is a boon.",
